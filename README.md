# BitcoinGrabber
Python Script used to test the security of the 12word mnemonic passphrase of Blockchain.com

You need chromedriver for this and you need to make some changes based on your screen dimensions.
The script opens a headless chromedriver and tries getting into blockchain portfolios through autogenerated passphrases.

This is just for testing purposes only.
